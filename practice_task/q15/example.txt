1.5.6 Stream Result Handling Pattern
Node.js Client API functions return an object with a stream method that returns a Readable stream
on the results from MarkLogic. Streams enable you to process results incrementally. Consider
using streaming if you’re reading a large number of documents or if your documents are large.
Streams can provide better throughput at lower memory overhead than the Promises when you’re
working with large amounts of data because result data can be processed as it is received from
MarkLogic Server.
